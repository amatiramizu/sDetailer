# sDetailer Extension for SwarmUI

sDetailer takes the approach of integrated object detection/segmentation with YOLO within SwarmUI, improves on it, and makes the options easily accessible in the sidebar.

(Manual installation from within the src/Extensions folder in SwarmUI with git clone, rebuild with launch-windows-dev.ps1 or launch-linux-dev.sh)
